                    <p>Hi, I am Rumy! Some people call me "fox", "cute dog", "red dog from the Internet". But I'm a big,
                        formidable
                        dog, I
                        am Shiba-Inu. And this is a story of my journey. Looking ahead, I will say that unexpectedly, I
                        found myself
                        in a
                        different part of the globe.</p>
                    <p>I had a wonderfully peaceful life in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Warm couch, delicious food, long
                        walks
                        with my
                        man. By
                        the way, I own four people: a pair of adults and two human puppies. I love my cubs, although
                        sometimes I am
                        ready to
                        devour them. As for adults, well, I would like to learn how to open the frige myself to take my
                        food, and
                        then I can
                        get rid of groun ups. Oh, and there's Sofina, big fluffy mouse of Pomeranian breed.</p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, as I said, I had a pretty good time in Saint-Petersburg…

                        But suddenly, at the end of February 2022, everything has changed. There was a feeling of
                        depression, anxiety in the
                        family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something unusual was happening. I was taken to the vet twice; they did tests for antibodies to
                        the
                        rabies virus and a
                        test for leishmaniasis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This went on for a while, and at the beginning of July, my people began to pack their bags. I
                        thought we were going on
                        vacation by car. We've done this before, it was a lot of fun. But this time there were
                        containers
                        for me and Sofina and
                        my people did not rejoice in the coming journey. And then one morning my people loaded the
                        suitcases
                        into the car (and
                        me and Sofina in containers) and went to the airport. I counted 6 suitcases, 4 hand luggage and
                        2
                        dog cages. It wasn't
                        easy for my people to handle all our luggage, but they did it. Luckily, the driver and airport
                        staff
                        were very kind and
                        helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We went through all the formalities at the airport and to my displeasure, the airport workers
                        took
                        me and the Sofina and
                        placed us in the luggage compartment of the aircraft.

                                So, my journey has begun. It was dark and noisy inside the plane’s hold. My people put
                                some
                                ice
                                cubes in my watering can
                                and I had water during the flight. We flew by Turkish Airlines, the flight was delayed
                                by
                                1.5
                                hours,
                                but all the rest
                                went well and after 4 hours flight we arrived to Istanbul.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My man later said that he asked the flight attendant several times how the dogs were
                                doing.
                                I
                                doubt
                                this, probably he
                                was just enjoying his flight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My people left part of bags in the luggage room and we checked into a hotel near the
                                airport. It
                                was
                                warm and good in
                                Istanbul.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We spent two nights at the hotel and drove back to the airport. It turned out that in
                                Istanbul
                                there
                                was only a long gap
                                between the flights (40 hours).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After a short wait at the airport, Sofina and I were again placed in the luggage
                                compartment
                                of
                                the
                                aircraft. But this
                                time the flight took 17 hours (with a stopover in San Paolo)!!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, late in the evening we arrived in Buenos Aires. Apparently, my man was tired from
                                the
                                flight,
                                because he forgot one
                                of our suitcases at the airport. Fortunately, he himself realized that the bag was
                                missing
                                and
                                managed to pick it up.
                                Finally, we took all our luggage and spent the night in the hotel in the center of
                                Buenos
                                Aires.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was going to rest at the hotel, but my man explained that we needed to buy tickets for
                                the
                                ferry.
                                It turned out that
                                Buenos Aires was not the final destination of our trip.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The difficulty was that russian bank cards do not work abroad and you cannot buy tickets
                                online.
                                Therefore, we were
                                looking for an ATM that works with the Chinese payment system Union Pay to withdrawal
                                cash.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It appeared, my man did not rest enough, because he forgot his card in the ATM. Luckly,
                                the
                                girl
                                who
                                used the ATM after
                                him caught up with him and returned the card back. In general, we met exceptionally good
                                people
                                along the way. This
                                gives hope that it is not all lost in the human world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then we got to the ferry terminal and bought tickets for everyone. The weather was good,
                                although it
                                was winter in
                                Argentina in July.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next morning we boarded the ferry and in less than 3 hours we arrived to the capital
                                of
                                Uruguay
                                – Montevideo.
                            </p>

                            Montevideo has welcomed us with clear blue sky, warm sun and calm sea. So, I ended up very
                            far
                            from home. Here my people
                            will have to start all over again, completely reset their lives and careers. That's all for
                            now.
                            Peace for everyone.
